        "In normal policy iteration, the algorithm performs exact policy evaluation to determine the value function for a given policy, and then performs exact policy improvement to obtain a better policy based on the value function. This process is repeated until the policy converges to an optimal policy. Exact policy evaluation involves solving a set of linear equations or matrix inversion, which can be computationally expensive, especially for large problems.\n",

        "In modified policy iteration, the algorithm performs approximate policy evaluation using value iteration, and then performs approximate policy improvement to obtain a better policy based on the approximate value function. This process is repeated until the policy converges to an optimal policy. Value iteration involves iteratively updating the value function using the Bellman equation, which is less computationally expensive than exact policy evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The advantage of modified policy iteration over normal policy iteration is that it can converge to an optimal policy faster, especially for large problems, because it avoids the computational expense of exact policy evaluation. However, the policy obtained by modified policy iteration may not be as accurate as the one obtained by normal policy iteration because it relies on approximations.\n",

Specifically, it involves estimating the value function of a policy for some states, without necessarily having information about the policy for all states.\n",

        "One common approach to partial policy evaluation is to use the Bellman equation, which relates the value function of a state to the value function of its successor states.
